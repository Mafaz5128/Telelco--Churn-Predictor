# Telecom Churn Predictor

## Project Description
This project is a **machine learning web application** that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to **churn** (leave the service) or **stay**.  
It integrates a **FastAPI backend** with a trained ML model and a **React frontend** for user interaction. The system allows telecom operators to quickly assess customer churn risk and take preventive measures.  

The project is also containerized with **Docker** for deployment and can be easily hosted on platforms such as **Render**.
